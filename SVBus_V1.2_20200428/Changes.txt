--------------

- Microsoft bug in esent.dll solved for Windows 10 x64 Build 1803 and later
  We now set a serial number offset and a serial number in the structure
  STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR. This solves the esent bug. Details are listed
  in the ReadMe.txt topic named "Application and Service Crashes on Windows
  10 x64 Build 1909 with SVBus version 1.1".
- mode page caching added for MODE SENSE (6) command
  The virtual HDD needs MODE PAGE CACHING to display the tab Policies in the
  Properties of the HDD in device manager.
- repacked due to heuristical virus detection
  We see a false positive heuristical virus detection on www.virustotal.com
  in 9 out of 70 checks for svbusx64.sys. Even sourceforge does show a warning
  for the download of our archive file. The 64 bit driver is detected as a
  malware named Gen.Variant.Johnnie.208251. After we changed the build path to
  something other than svbus we are not detected anymore.


Changes V1.1
--------------

- TrueCrypt V7.1a full system disk encryption is now supported
  SVBus V1.0 was not working in combination with TrueCrypt V7.1a full system disk
  encryption. We changed the way SVBus V1.1 searches the GRUB4DOS signature string.
  If we can not find the GRUB4DOS signature inside the actual INT13 handler we try
  to search the entire 640 KB RAM area. This way we can even detect the GRUB4DOS
  loader if INT13 got hooked by another program.
